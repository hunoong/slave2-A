# Week 01 [24.07.20] 
## Introduction 
So today we started to look at the terms what Parametric & Generative design is first.

**Parametric Design** is dependent on variables that change the geometry or other factors (like a template)<br/>
**Generative Design** creates new objects or visuals where there were not any before (as if you are growing something) <br/>

###### I wasn't that sure about the terms and I thought it would be better to understand it as much as I can. So I looked up a bit more. <br/>
The Wikipedia says :<br/>
Generative design is an iterative design process that involves a program that will generate a certain number of outputs that meet certain constraints, and a designer that will fine tune the feasible region *(=the area that possible to do sth easily? 실행가능한 영역)* by changing minimal and maximal values(값) of an interval in which a variable *(=변수?)* of the program meets the set of constraints, in order to reduce or increase the number of outputs to choose from. <br/>

Parametric design is a process based on algorithmic thinking that enables the expression of parameters *(=규정 요인?)* and rules that, together, define, encode and clarify the relationship between design intent and design response.

During the class, I was pretty fascinated how our daily lives heavily rely on our own algorithmic processes. And I realised every moments when I do my chores(Like, I like to do several things all together to make things easier, but also it takes a lot of my energy.), they are formed by my own big-data which is my past experiences. My 'Own personal life formed big data' was forming my personal algorithms.<br/>

<br/>

## Group Activity
We divided into small groups and did some 'Parametric Drawing'.<br/>
Our group set up rules by using different dice.<br/>

It was really interesting to see everyone's outcomes as the outcomes of each group was so different to each other and I thought I would try it differently if I would do it again. But still I really liked our group's outcomes as well.<br/>
For mine, I didn't go out of the paper as I kind of feel secure in it, but I saw a different outcome by one of my group members and it was quite interesting how he goes out of the paper and also started his first mark in the middle of the paper.<br/>
Also, it's kind of nice to see a messy red lines of mine in the bottom centre as I didn't think carefully(it was because of my misunderstanding of rules)enough and later on, I realised it and I modified it on top of it. So it does look a bit messy, but I like how it looks as it shows my ~~missunderstanding~~ attempts.

I was so fascinated by them. This webpage is not only aesthethic but also shows how each films has their own colours as representative.
Also it shows how colours can communicate the essence and emotion of the films.<br/>
