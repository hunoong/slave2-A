# Week 02 [31.07.20] 

## Pop-up Activity : 12-hour Challenge
We were asked to do '12-hour challenge'. I had to consider what my own 'systems' were.
There aren't much time to describe my all 12 hours, so I focused on making my dinner.
I tried to convert my own processes into texts. And then I added some rules for taking risks. 
At this point, I was super curious what I would eat eventually.
I decided to film myself as I thought that would be the best way to show the real time process.
At first, I thought I did a bit much, but my friends liked *[my Vlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb-L2_n0sg4&t=6s)* so..

## Summary of week 2
Today we went trough a bunch of artists from 백남준 *(Nam June Paik/ we talked about him at the start of the class for a bit)* to Raven Kwok.<br/>
*(+ Yoko Ono, Sol Lewitt, Manfred Mohr, Roman Verasko, Harold Cohen, Samuel Monnior, Jean Pierre Hebert and Angelo Plessas)*

When Karen mentioned about 'Sublime' as an aesthetic force while speaking of *Sol Lewitt*, I actually quite didn't get it, but vaguely understood.<br/>
So I looked it up a bit more.<br/>

This is what Wiki said :<br/>
*In aesthetics, the sublime(숭고함? 절정?) is the quality of greatness, whether physical, moral, intellectual, metaphysical, aesthetic, spiritual, or artistic. The term especially refers to a greatness beyond all possibility of calculation, measurement, or imitation.*<br/>

Among them, for me ***Manfred Mohr*** was quite impressive as he was a painter, but he tried to collaborate with a machine. He set basic parameters and created his parametic designs based one that(He wanted the machine to take decisions that he would not have).<br/>

And this reminded me of ***[James Nolan Gandy](https://instagram.com/gandyworks?igshid=1aunivtu21u7l)***, a drawing machinist.<br/>

In terms of 'Human-machine collaboration', I think they are similar to some extend, as James also seems like taking machines' decisions as well. I mean, everything's probably based on the artist's thought and decisions(like, specific machine set ups on purpose?), but still it seems like they are "collaborating".<br/>

## Processing Workshop 01 & Remixing
We experimented with the processing for the first time. At first I was a little bit worried because I had a bad memory that I was struggling to learn the processing when I was in 2013 in Korea. But things went pretty okay. We've learned some basic function such as how to draw **lines**, what are **parameters** are, drawing **ellipse**, **R,G,B values** and using **mouseX** and **mouseY**. <br/> 
And then we made our self portraits. I did not like what I made though, it was fun to play with it.<br/>

We also learned how to export files via 'Tools - Movie Maker'.

I remixed Yerim's work as I thought it was pretty interesting and fun. Then I came up with an idea to make it into Disney Characters.<br/>
So I tried to make it look like 'Elsa' from Frozen.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Group Discussion - inputs & outputs
In our group discussion time, we discussed about what are 10 inputs and 10 outputs are.<br/>

We came up with interesting ideas from Growth to Location information. <br/>
Among these, I actually pretty liked mine which were : Growth(Mould), Movements(Others) and Tracking Ants.<br/>
As I'm stuck at home, I just like to watch people walking along the path & some wild animals flying outside. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Extra Research
I explored about more terms in processing in Korean to understand them better before it gets too difficult..<br/>
Also, I found some interesting videos on Instagram. The first gif is 'Choosing your boyfriend's outfit randomly' and the second gif is the same structure but with a dog. <br/>
It was just hilarious and interesting as well because they are also based on small algorithms that we explored over the week(12hrs challenge).<br/>
