# Week 02 [31.07.20] 

## Pop-up Activity : 12-hour Challenge
We were asked to do '12-hour challenge'. I had to consider what my own 'systems' were.
There aren't much time to describe my all 12 hours, so I focused on making my dinner.
I tried to convert my own processes into texts. And then I added some rules for taking risks. 
At this point, I was super curious what I would eat eventually.
I decided to film myself as I thought that would be the best way to show the real time process.
At first, I thought I did a bit much, but my friends liked *[my Vlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hb-L2_n0sg4&t=6s)* so..

## Summary of week 2
Today we went trough a bunch of artists from 백남준 *(Nam June Paik/ we talked about him at the start of the class for a bit)* to Raven Kwok.<br/>
*(+ Yoko Ono, Sol Lewitt, Manfred Mohr, Roman Verasko, Harold Cohen, Samuel Monnior, Jean Pierre Hebert and Angelo Plessas)*

When Karen mentioned about 'Sublime' as an aesthetic force while speaking of *Sol Lewitt*, I actually quite didn't get it, but vaguely understood.<br/>
So I looked it up a bit more.<br/>

This is what Wiki said :<br/>
*In aesthetics, the sublime(숭고함? 절정?) is the quality of greatness, whether physical, moral, intellectual, metaphysical, aesthetic, spiritual, or artistic. The term especially refers to a greatness beyond all possibility of calculation, measurement, or imitation.*<br/>

Among them, for me ***Manfred Mohr*** was quite impressive as he was a painter, but he tried to collaborate with a machine. He set basic parameters and created his parametic designs based one that(He wanted the machine to take decisions that he would not have).<br/>

And this reminded me of ***[James Nolan Gandy](https://instagram.com/gandyworks?igshid=1aunivtu21u7l)***, a drawing machinist.<br/>

In terms of 'Human-machine collaboration', I think they are similar to some extend, as James also seems like taking machines' decisions as well. I mean, everything's probably based on the artist's thought and decisions(like, specific machine set ups on purpose?), but still it seems like they are "collaborating".
