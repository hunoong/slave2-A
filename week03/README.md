## Summary of week 3
This week, we explored a bunch of case studies in related to ways of systems that give something else the power to make the decision for you. 
During the class, Louis asked how important is the performer on 'Drawing Machine #1' by Josheph Griffiths and got some interesting answers back from Andy and Karen.<br/>
They said that human being(body) is working as *a performer* at the same time *co-creator* and *operator.* So basically, the machine will do nothing untill human activates it. By activating it, this collaboration work will create some synergy which makes this work interesting. 

## Unplugged Activity : Nonhuman Markmaking
If the processing workshop we did last week was an intense activity, this unplugged one hour activity during the lunch break was very relaxing in a way because I made my own physical things with my hands that I can directly see the progress. To create these 'semi-autonomous nonhuman mark-making machines', I firstly had to think about some kind of force or repetitive activities that I can use for my machine. I came up with several ideas and initially, I wanted to make four different painting pieces and combine them all together at the end to create one big painting. But it wasn't quite working. <br/>
So I ended up creating three different artpieces : 1) Using natural phenomena, 2) Me as a human force and 3) Using the fridge. <br/>
<br/>

**(1) Using natural phenomena <br/>**
It was very interesting to acknowlege that this idea was derived from my elective class, 'Temporal Drawing' from last semester. <br/>
In this course, one of my assignments was 'Drawing with matter and turbulence'. And some example artworks that we went through were using natural phenomena or animals to create some collaborative works. I just felt very impressed that two different courses were intertwined in a way. <br/>
So I decided to use the wind, my laundry rack and some makers with strings to create some drawing out of the wind. <br/>
However, the weather was pretty calm today and couldn't create drawings that I wanted to. But still the process was enjoyable. <br/>

**(2) 'Me' as a humman-force**
I was inspired by 'Kinetograph', one of the case studies in the slide by Sage Dawson. By wearing her machine and walking around, she creates some interesting paintings out of it. I also wanted to create some works by using my body movement, so I tried to find some objects that can move easily - a sticky lint roller.
I then attached a paper and brushes to it. And then I tied that machine around my waist and walked around. However, as the acrylic paints that I use was a little bit thick and the brush was a little bit heavy, I counldn't create interesting outcomes as I wanted to.

**(3) Using the fridge**
This one came out as the best among three approaches. I came up with this idea at the start of the case study slides though, during the class 'using fridge to create a painting' mentioned already so I didn't want to do it. But as previous two attempts didn't come out as nicely as I wanted so I decided to give it a shot. Even though it was the last try and kind of improvising attempt, it came out pretty intresting as I liked how it worked with the amount of force I put.<br/>
It was very interesting that there were several dots on the paper. And I realised those pools of 'ink form' represent my 'lunch decision making' as they were created where I paused when I try to make up my mind what to eat. <br/>
