## Unplugged Activity : Nonhuman Markmaking
If the processing workshop we did last week was an intense activity, this unplugged activity was very relaxing in a way because I made my own physical things with my hands. To create these 'semi-autonomous nonhuman mark-making machines', I firstly had to think about some kind of force or repetitive activities that I can use for my machine. I came up with several ideas : 1) Using natural phenomena, 2) Me as a human force and 3) Using the fridge. <br/>
<br/>
**(1) Using natural phenomena <br/>**
It was very interesting to acknowlege that this idea was derived from my elective class, 'Temporal Drawing' from last semester. <br/>
In this course, one of my assignments was 'Drawing with matter and turbulence'. And some example artworks that we went through were using natural phenomena or animals to create some collaborative works. I just felt very impressed that two different courses were intertwined in a way. <br/>
So I decided to use the wind, my laundry hanger and some makers with strings to create some drawing out of the wind. <br/>
However, the weather was pretty calm today and couldn't create drawings that I wanted to. But still the process was enjoyable. <br/>

**(2) 'Me' as a humman-force**
