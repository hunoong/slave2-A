## Summary of week 3
This week, we explored a bunch of case studies in related to ways of systems that give something else the power to make the decision for you. <br/>

During the class, Louis asked how important is the performer on ***'Drawing Machine #1' by Josheph Griffiths*** and got some interesting answers back from Andy and Karen. They said that human being(body) is working as *a performer* at the same time *co-creator* and *operator.* So basically, the machine will do nothing untill human activates it. By activating it, this collaboration work will create some synergy which makes this work interesting. <br/>

## Unplugged Activity : Nonhuman Markmaking
If the processing workshop we did last week was an intense activity, this unplugged one hour activity during the lunch break was very relaxing in a way because I made my own physical things with my hands that I can directly see the progress.<br/>

To create these 'semi-autonomous nonhuman mark-making machines', I firstly had to think about some kind of force or repetitive activities that I can use for my machine. I came up with several ideas. And initially, I wanted to make four different painting pieces and combine them all together at the end to create one big painting. But it wasn't quite working. <br/>
So I ended up creating three different artpieces : 1) Using natural phenomena, 2) Me as a human force and 3) Using the fridge. <br/>

**(1) Using natural phenomena <br/>**
It was very interesting to acknowlege that this idea was derived from my elective class, 'Temporal Drawing' from last semester. <br/>
In this course, one of my assignments was 'Drawing with matter and turbulence'. And some example artworks that we went through were using natural phenomena or animals to create some collaborative works. I just felt very impressed that two different courses were intertwined in a way. <br/>
So I decided to use the wind, my laundry rack and some makers with strings to create some drawing out of the wind. <br/>
However, the weather was pretty calm today and couldn't create drawings that I wanted to. But still the process was enjoyable. <br/>

**(2) 'Me' as a humman-force** <br/>
I was inspired by 'Kinetograph', one of the case studies in the slide by Sage Dawson. By wearing her machine and walking around, she creates some interesting paintings out of it. I also wanted to create some works by using my body movement, so I tried to find some objects that can move easily - a sticky lint roller.
I then attached a paper and brushes to it. And then I tied that machine around my waist and walked around. However, as the acrylic paints that I use was a little bit thick and the brush was a little bit heavy, I counldn't create interesting outcomes as I wanted to.<br/>

**(3) Using the fridge** <br/>
This one came out as the best among three approaches. I came up with this idea at the start of the case study slides though, during the class 'using fridge to create a painting' mentioned already so I didn't want to do it. But as previous two attempts didn't come out as nicely as I wanted so I decided to give it a shot. Even though it was the last try and kind of improvising attempt, it came out pretty intresting as I liked how it worked with the amount of force I put.<br/>
It was very interesting that there were several dots on the paper. And I realised those pools of 'ink form' represent my 'lunch decision making' as they were created where I paused when I try to make up my mind what to eat. <br/>

**Final Outcomes**<br/>

## Group Discussion
We divided into groups and asked to fill the *'Processes*' in the <*Inputs and Outputs> sheet*. <br/>
It was a bit confusing to put processes to it as some inputs and outputs are not that connecting, but it was nice to think about the possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
I think our group spent the most time on thinking about the process for the *'Output - Shooting Frisbee'*. <br/>
The input that already in was *'Co-ordinates'*. We struggled to think about the process that we need. I think later we came up with *'Frisbee thowing machine' and 'Catapult'* for the process but, while we were discussing about what to put, I thought it would be much better if we switch the output and input(which doesn't really make sense though). So decided to talk about my thought even if it will be rejected by memebers. And it got rejected! <br/>
But I still think that it's good to see a different point of view(like a reversed view) when you stuck with something even though it may not fit to the current rule or something.

Later, ***Andy*** jumped in for feedback. <br/>
I think we got some interesting feedback from him so I wrote it down. 
He says there are people who are more like 'problem solvers' or 'problem finders'. It'd be nice if we can find a better problem one that suits us. And also he mentioned about one of the risks that we can get which is you lock in your ideas and stop being experimental. So when you lock something in relly quick, you will miss out some potential(= Happy accidents) oppurtunities in the process. <br/>
By doing these <Inputs and outputs>, it asked you to see that everything you do is a prism which pushes out lots of different lights. By adding ideas and thinking about it, you will have an oppurtunity to get various possibilities from that one pitch. 

Later, ***Karen*** jumped in for feedback.<br/>
I shared my current pitch ideas. I came up an idea of 'The image of self-objectification'. <br/>
I wanted to visualise my personal data about my procrastination time and focusing time that I have been recording. So by using this personal data, I wanted to create some kind of 'Smart lamps' that support you by brighten up your place depending on your focusing time. <br/>

Karen gave me an advice to think a little bit larger and one step away from my personal data. Such as an architecture intervention or even interior design concept related to mind waves to assist you to acheive your goals. <br/>


## Wrapping up
Andy and Karen suggested to come up with dozens of ideas and then try them out first rather than think just one solution. This is because it is much easier to know how you feel about something than how you think about something.
