**1)** I found this game(the left image) on Open Processing. And I was quite interested in the style of the work and how simple it is.<br/>
The one rule is to just click the mouse at the right time. So I found the mouse function part in the Sketch code, but still have no idea how it works. So I looked up some other work by this person, and as I’m into paintings and drawings, I immediately clicked these two works.<br/>
<br/>
**2)** The portrait one is basically generating photos into paintings so at the start of the code it says ‘const photo’ which maybe stands for ‘a constant’? and feels like it’s linking the photos to their work. And then there is the code ‘let imgs’, idk how it works, but it feels like it’s related to creating random paths and strokes in paintings as I found the language ‘let x = random’. This work feels like functioning the same as the first game one bc it has the language ‘mouseClicked’.<br/>
<br/>
**3)** Lastly, the third one has the shortest code among the three works. This is a painting auto generator, and I assumed it’s drawn with ellipse as it looked similar to what we’ve done last week, and I think I was right as I found the language ‘ellipse’ in the code. I have no clue how it generates automatically, but feels like it’s related to a language [sh=createShader]. So I looked up the term ‘shader’ and it’s related to shadings in 3D scenes. I also found a shader tutorial in the Processing webpage.<br/>

## Processing Workshop 02 
Today we had another processing workshop session.<br/>
We learned to save the sketch and create a folder. If I add a photo directly to the processing sketch window, the photo will automatically appear in the folder.<br/>
Also , I found that if the size(pixels) of the photo is not even number, the photo can't really be in the centre.<br/>
<br/>

###### Some notes 
- *Image(photo,x,y);* // x and y are the positions)<br/>
- Instead of writing (R,G,B), *color pix = photo.get(mouseX, mouseY);* // The colour is going to be the pixel values of wherever the mouse is.
- *map(input, lowest value in, highest value in, lowest value out, highest value out)*
- *t = int(random(256);* // a full range from full transparent to opaque.
- For fonts, we first need to create fonts into data folder. (From 'Tools')
- *textAlign(Center,Top);* // Centre=Horizontal, Top=Vertical
- *spin+=1;
   rotate(spin); // The value '1' keeps adding for spinning

**Adding photo** <br/>

###### Intereting notes
- Karen mentioned that scientifically your coding memory will last only for 25 hrs. So don't think my coding memory lasts longer because later when you see the examples or sketches you made, you won't quite get them directly.<br/>

## Group Discussion - Your Pitch
So we divided into small groups and Karen said we need to speak of our speculative design project. <br/>
She also mentioned that *the spirit of sharing is to expand the idea of 'what if?'*. We need to listen to our peers ideas, suggest ways we could test the outcomes or we could test the input or process.. This is because we are looking at the ideal of generative/paramatric system for design. <br/>
Unfortunately, unlike what Karen said 'See how can group of memebers improve or test elements', our group barely talked.. it was very difficult..<br/>
However, after Andy joined in, we talked a little bit more and were able to share our ideas.<br/>
<br/>
After sharing my ideas, I asked to Andy whether the project should has some meanings behind the aesthetic because I wanted to focus only on the beautiness. Andy's advice was very interesting as he said that 'The aesthetic means 'meaning'','The meaning can come from the aesthetic'. So it doesn't have to have some kind of a social awareness behind it, and that I could focus on purely aesthetic. The studio project could be an abstract as well.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Andy's encouragement, I was able to share more ideas of mine which was 'The live digital painting that captures natural phenomena'.<br/>
I'm actually really into this idea(I'm not sure how it can be made though) than the interior clock one. Because, I just wanted to create a 'purely aesthetic experience'. And Andy said it is good idea that it captures real world aspects near me and to bring it into the screen.<br/>

## Idea development after the class

I developed & organised my ideas into a piece of sheet and into some drawings after today's class.<br/>
There are still a bunch of things on going in my mind which is good I think, but need to pick and see what is the most relevant to my pracitce or interest etc..<br/>
