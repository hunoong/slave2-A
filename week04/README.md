## Processing Workshop 02 
Today we had another processing workshop session.<br/>
We learned to save the sketch and create a folder. If I add a photo directly to the processing sketch window, the photo will automatically appear in the folder.<br/>
Also , I found that if the size(pixels) of the photo is not even number, the photo can't really be in the centre.<br/>
<br/>

###### Some notes 
- *Image(photo,x,y);* // x and y are the positions)<br/>
- Instead of writing (R,G,B), *color pix = photo.get(mouseX, mouseY);* // The colour is going to be the pixel values of wherever the mouse is.
- *map(input, lowest value in, highest value in, lowest value out, highest value out)*
- *t = int(random(256);* // a full range from full transparent to opaque.
- For fonts, we first need to create fonts into data folder. (From 'Tools')
- *textAlign(Center,Top);* // Centre=Horizontal, Top=Vertical
- *spin+=1;
   rotate(spin); // The value '1' keeps adding for spinning

###### Intereting notes
- Karen mentioned that scientifically your coding memory will last only for 25 hrs. So don't think my coding memory lasts longer because later when you see the examples or sketches you made, you won't quite get them directly.
