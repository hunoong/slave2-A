I was very lost and wonderer if I was doing it right. <br/>
I couldn't make up my mind as there were many ideas that I wanted to challenge and explore. And there were small and personal ideas than big ones. But I have heard some advice that 'personal things can be creative', so I decided to proceed with personal things. But I've expanded my target audience and ideas larger so that more people can relate to it. <br/>

I sent an inquiry to Karen and while I was waiting for her reply, I found that three or four of my ideas were tied together(as a mental health-interior design). When I got back from Karen I was surprised and happy(haha) a bit as she gave me similar advice! So I proceeded the pitch afterwards. <br/>

My pitch was a future-oriented idea, and it was a low-possible idea right now(for me), so I was a little at a loss how to start it, but I decided that it was better to investigate the grounds to support the idea first. So I first began to research the main reasons for **<*social networks' impact on mental health*>**, **<*the positive aspects of music and color on mental health*>** and **<*the work at home efficiency due to coronavirus*>**. <br/>
At the same time,**<*the correlation between emotion and brain waves*>** was investigated and **<*products and technologies related to brain waves*>** were explored to further support the evidence. The slides were then completed by adding inputs & outputs and other details. <br/>

During the presentation, I watched and listened to other classmates' contents and felt that mine was a little different and something was lacking. Of course, it was good to see various unique ideas from them. <br/>
So I personally asked Karen for feedback after class and she answered kindly. <br/>

## **Here's the feedback I got:**
Case study is great, but could've added more about products in the market using Neuro Sky or artists in this area.(e.g. Neuro Installation, Lauren McCarthy...) The Ideal of light and music theraphy + clock is interesting but it would've been nice if what bits are changing, interactive according to inputs(like potentials?). It would've been better if it had an extended manual of how it assists someone who owns this or show how can it be able to controlled for guiding the visualisation.<br/>

We also talked about 'Electric Activity of Brain'.<br/>
It was very interesting that Karen mentioned 'What can it tell us and what can it unlock rather than a record or representation what is happening.' Like, *'Fitbit'* for instance, it can show you the heartbeat status but users are not engaging directly with it.<br/>
Maybe I could've promoted it better by promoting it with 'This object makes you have the better behaviour' or something. Karen also gave an example which I really liked, 'If one feels too nervous than the device stops the music. And maybe it could guide you to calm down by locking your phone if you are upset...'<br/>
<br/>
Lastly,there was very interesting conversation went on.<br/>
Karen mentioned that *'How does this algorithm of human emotion work? Looking at our own codes? What would be the recipe for happiness?'*.<br/>
<br/>
And as soon as I heard this, I was surprised because I literally was thinking about how emotions work the other day. I was making some connection between **[my past memories when I was in USA when I was 10 years old]** and **[my previous experience in Karen & Andy's class when I was in year one.]**<br/>
<br/>
I was a bit overwhelmed with my first studio class with them, and was a bit scared of being there even though I liked to learn and enjoyed it in a way. I think this is because the studio was really open and free feeling class, so I was a bit scared to be exposed in that atmosphere? Or maybe it was because my English was worse... But I think the main reason for being overwhelmed and that led to not applying for other classes by them after that class, was as I mentioned earlier, I somehow remembered my awful memories when I was in USA. I was thinking about it and then realised maybe that made me feel frustrated.<br/>
However, now I feel super proud of myself that now I'm taking their class again. And glad that I got my first preference for my last semester in RMIT. It is still very challenging and difficult, but I am learning a lot.<br/>
<br/>

## Inspiration of the week

I think this is how I will feel about while working for the final project in the future.<br/>
This can be just seeing as a funny meme or showing how programmers get frustrated with their machines or codes... but this can be also showing your ability to detour. Sometimes you have to go back without being confronted about what's coming. (Words from *'Success in the Arts: What It Takes to Make It in Creative Fields by A. Michael Shumate'*). Or this can be a 'Happy Accident'.<br/>
