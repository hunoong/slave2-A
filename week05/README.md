I was very lost and wonderer if I was doing it right. <br/>
I couldn't make up my mind as there were many ideas that I wanted to challenge and explore. And there were small and personal ideas than big ones. But I have heard some advice that 'personal things can be creative', so I decided to proceed with personal things. But I've expanded my target audience and ideas larger so that more people can relate to it. <br/>

I sent an inquiry to Karen and while I was waiting for her reply, I found that three or four of my ideas were tied together(as a mental health-interior design). When I got back from Karen I was surprised and happy(haha) a bit as she gave me similar advice! So I proceeded the pitch afterwards. <br/>

My pitch was a future-oriented idea, and it was a low-possible idea right now(for me), so I was a little at a loss how to start it, but I decided that it was better to investigate the grounds to support the idea first. So I first began to research the main reasons for **<*social networks' impact on mental health*>**, **<*the positive aspects of music and color on mental health*>** and **<*the work at home efficiency due to coronavirus*>**. <br/>
At the same time,**<*the correlation between emotion and brain waves*>** was investigated and **<*products and technologies related to brain waves*>** were explored to further support the evidence. The slides were then completed by adding inputs & outputs and other details. <br/>

During the presentation, I watched and listened to other classmates' contents and felt that mine was a little different and something was lacking. Of course, it was good to see various unique ideas from them. <br/>
So I personally asked Karen for feedback after class and she answered kindly. <br/>
