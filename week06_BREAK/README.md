# Week 06 Mid Semester Break [04.09.20] 
After decided to work on ***'Animal detecting system'***, I was on the stage where considering which program or even physical machine to use. So I went through **'Open Cv'** on both **Processing** and **Python** first.<br/>
<br/>
During the break, there are several things that I have found, have practised and explored. <br/>

## Processing Tutorials
I went through several **processing-OPEN CV** tutorials and sketches including capturing background(both static background and moving background).<br/>
[OpenCv for Processing](https://github.com/atduskgreg/opencv-processing)
## Problem Solving process- Camera not working in the processing
While I was exploring those, I found out that there's a problem in creating capture in Processing on my Mac(Mac os13).<br/>

To solve this issue, I googled a lot and tried to find people those who have same issues with me and to find answers from forums.<br/>
I went through every single post on the forum that I found[Video capture not working in Mac OS Catalina #134](https://github.com/processing/processing-video/issues/134), and tried to follow some of the solutions or suggestions they have.<br/>

I spent most of my time tried these suggestions. I had no idea how those suggestions work, so I had to google about from opening the terminal to adding commands into strings...<br/>
<br/>
Even though I tried all I can do by myself, it didn't work. So I had to change my plan. I reallised that I have Windows 10 that my brother-in-law once gave it to me. So I initiated the BoothCamp on Mac and installed Windows10. After installing it, I was able to open up the Processing there and was able to open the webcam.<br/>

## Python Tutorial exploration & Research
At the same time, I also explored basic Python OpenCv and OpenCV for detection(to track animals later).<br/>
First, I learned some basic functions from [Python Tutorial - Python for Beginners by Programming with Mosh on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc&list=PLkYK-w4inUUwaAY_1CARjUsuAfgAWvrCY&index=29&t=318s&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMosh)<br/>

*(The right image is showing 'cmd+click' that shows the function of the language.)*<br/>
Also, I found many articles and tutorials that try to detecting objects or animals by using Open CV. I went through tutorials mostly on Youtube.<br/>

*(The right image is showing how I imported libraries and video capture.)*>br/>
