# Week 06 Mid Semester Break [04.09.20] 
After decided to work on ***'Animal detecting system'***, I was on the stage where considering which program or even physical machine to use. So I went through **'Open Cv'** on both **Processing** and **Python** first.<br/>
<br/>
During the break, there are several things that I have found, have practised and explored. <br/>
<br/>

## Processing Tutorials
I went through several **processing-OPEN CV** tutorials and sketches including capturing background(both static background and moving background).<br/>
[OpenCv for Processing](https://github.com/atduskgreg/opencv-processing)
## Problem Solving process- Camera not working in the processing
While I was exploring those, I found out that there's a problem in creating capture in Processing on my Mac(Mac os13).<br/>

To solve this issue, I googled a lot and tried to find people those who have same issues with me and to find answers from forums.<br/>
I went through every single post on the forum that I found[Video capture not working in Mac OS Catalina #134](https://github.com/processing/processing-video/issues/134), and tried to follow some of the solutions or suggestions they have.<br/>

I spent most of my time tried these suggestions. I had no idea how those suggestions work, so I had to google about from opening the terminal to adding commands into strings...<br/>
<br/>
Even though I tried all I can do by myself, it didn't work. So I had to change my plan. I reallised that I have Windows 10 that my brother-in-law once gave it to me. So I initiated the BoothCamp on Mac and installed Windows10. After installing it, I was able to open up the Processing there and was able to open the webcam.<br/>
<br/>

## Python Tutorial exploration & Research
At the same time, I also explored basic Python OpenCv and OpenCV for detection(to track animals later).<br/>
And I also wanted to know whether the Mac webcam is working on Python or not(it did work).<br/>
First, I learned some basic functions from [Python Tutorial - Python for Beginners by Programming with Mosh on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc&list=PLkYK-w4inUUwaAY_1CARjUsuAfgAWvrCY&index=29&t=318s&ab_channel=ProgrammingwithMosh)<br/>

*(The right image is showing 'cmd+click' that shows the function of the language.)*<br/>
<br/>
Also, I found many articles and tutorials that try to detecting objects or animals by using Open CV. I went through tutorials mostly on Youtube.<br/>

*(The right image is showing how I imported libraries and video capture.)*<br/>
<br/>
Some of the object detection tutorials I followed are by <br/>
- [Murtaza's Workshop - Robotics and AI](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYUjYU5FveRAscQ8V21w81A)<br/>
I also tried to follow tutorials by <br/>
- [Adrian Rosebrock - Basic motion detection and tracking with Python and OpenCV](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/05/25/basic-motion-detection-and-tracking-with-python-and-opencv/)<br/>
I found some interesting articles : <br/>
-[Detecting animals in the backyard — practical application of deep learning. by Gaiar Baimuratov](https://towardsdatascience.com/detecting-animals-in-the-backyard-practical-application-of-deep-learning-c030d3263ba8)<br/>
-[This Motion-Detecting Wildlife Camera Was Made with Raspberry Pi by MICHAEL ZHANG](https://petapixel.com/2018/02/06/motion-detecting-wildlife-camera-made-raspberry-pi/)<br/>
I experimented some codes whether it is working for me as well :
- Tracking Rat [Animal Tracking by colinlaney](https://github.com/colinlaney/animal-tracking)<br/>
And if I can track objects, and animals, maybe I could combine drawing features together? So that animals can create drawings while they are being detected.<br/>
- [Object Tracking by ankurg22](https://github.com/ankurg22/object-tracking)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Python - OpenCV Practice
I practiced by it myself as well, testing things out and faced the problem and solved it via going throught some forums...<br/>
