# Week 06 Mid Semester Break [04.09.20] 
During the break, there are several things that I have found, have practised and explored. <br/>

## Processing Tutorials
I went through several **processing-OPEN CV** tutorials and sketches including capturing background(both static background and moving background).<br/>
[OpenCv for Processing](https://github.com/atduskgreg/opencv-processing)
## Problem Solving process- Camera not working in the processing
While I was exploring those, I found out that there's a problem in creating capture in Processing on my Mac(Mac os13).<br/>

To solve this issue, I googled a lot and tried to find people those who have same issues with me and to find answers from forums.<br/>
I went through every single post on the forum that I found[Video capture not working in Mac OS Catalina #134](https://github.com/processing/processing-video/issues/134), and tried to follow some of the solutions or suggestions they have.<br/>
