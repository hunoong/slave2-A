A typeface work by [Aiden Symes](www.instagram.com/aidensymes/)(and animated version by Vishakha Dharba).<br/>
It's a custom type for an article in 'The Atlantic' magazine. In pandemic situation, I totally relate to this kind of work. Especially the animated version of it looks very depressed and it just represents how I feel these days. The collapsing part seems like they applied some kind of gravity function. Works that reflect the times are always interesting. Because that reflects the current world I live in. Also, I may be more interested in their work because my practice is far from those work.<br/>
