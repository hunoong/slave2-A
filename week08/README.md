***["Collaging Collages" by Jamie Tung](https://jamtt.github.io/Codewords/Files/LaurenCollage/)***<br/>
This is a collage image generator by Jamie shown in class. I already knew that he is good at designing stuff, but this work was super interesting as it generates random collages by user's input(image size and the amount of images).

## During the week...

I explored p5.js Web editor and p5.js libraries([Vida Library](https://www.tetoki.eu/vida/)) to track movements and to detect objects.<br/>
I was struggling to import Vida library into the Sketch, but later I was able to import it by putting downloaded library files into the sketch folder.<br/>
I also explored different camera output functions using ["Epoccam"](https://www.kinoni.com/), and I was able to open Vida library through my webcam and my external webcam(by using Epoccam & my iPhone).<br/>

And then I made a quick sketch of transparent rectangle to see whether I can make a tool to hide webcam or not.(*the second image*)<br/>
<br/>
Then, I made the idea sketch more concise and underdtandable to guide not only myself but also to convey the idea to others easily for advice.<br/>

A typeface work by [Aiden Symes](www.instagram.com/aidensymes/)(and animated version by Vishakha Dharba).<br/>
It's a custom type for an article in 'The Atlantic' magazine. In pandemic situation, I totally relate to this kind of work. Especially the animated version of it looks very depressed and it just represents how I feel these days. The collapsing part seems like they applied some kind of gravity function. Works that reflect the times are always interesting. Because that reflects the current world I live in. Also, I may be more interested in their work because my practice is far from those work.<br/>
