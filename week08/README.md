***["Collaging Collages" by Jamie Tung](https://jamtt.github.io/Codewords/Files/LaurenCollage/)***<br/>
This is a collage image generator by Jamie shown in class. I already knew that he is good at designing stuff, but this work was super interesting as it generates random collages by user's input(image size and the amount of images).

## During the week...

I explored p5.js Web editor and p5.js libraries([Vida Library](https://www.tetoki.eu/vida/)) to track movements and to detect objects.<br/>
I was struggling to import Vida library into the Sketch, but later somehow I was able to import it by putting downloaded library files into the sketch folder. I also explored different camera output functions using ["Epoccam"](https://www.kinoni.com/), and I was able to open Vida library through my webcam and my external webcam(by using Epoccam & my iPhone).<br/>

And then I made a quick sketch of transparent rectangle to see whether I can make a tool to hide webcam or not.(*the second image*)<br/>
<br/>
Then, I made the idea sketch more concise and underdtandable to guide not only myself but also to convey the idea to others easily for advice.<br/>

## In Class...
It's a little embarrassing, but I just found out that we are supposed(or recommended) to study around 12 hours by ourselves outside of studio.<br/>
But because this studio was quite difficult, I had to take some time to study outside of class anyway, so I think I did it pretty well anyway..<br/>
<br/>
We learned how to add external libraries into our sketches, and we went through some sketch tutorial. We learned how to make wiggly letters by using "Class" and "Array" in the processing.<br/>

We also went through another tutorial using p5.js sound library.<br/>

It was very interesting to explore some features like that. It reminded me of a dictation function on my iPhone or Apple watch.<br/>

***After the class...***<br/>
I actually experimented it by myself again, whether I could take some sounds from nature(e.g. wind sound, tree sound or birds etc...). I thought it would be interesting to see if wind noise or some noise by tree leaves or birds chattering could transfer into 'human language system', but it didn't work. The dictator sketch couldn't get any noise from outside. Maybe the noise wansn't loud enough.. or there's no letter that matches to those noises.<br/>

## Case study - inspiration of the week02

A typeface work by [Aiden Symes](www.instagram.com/aidensymes/)(and animated version by Vishakha Dharba).<br/>
It's a custom type for an article in 'The Atlantic' magazine. In pandemic situation, I totally relate to this kind of work. Especially the animated version of it looks very depressed and it just represents how I feel these days. The collapsing part seems like they applied some kind of gravity function. Works that reflect the times are always interesting. Because that reflects the current world I live in. Also, I may be more interested in their work because my practice is far from those work.<br/>
