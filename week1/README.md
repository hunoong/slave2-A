# Week 01 [24.07.20] 
## Introduction 
So today we started to look at the terms-Parametric & Generative design-first. 

-**[parametric design]** is dependent on variables that change the geometry or other factors (like a template)
-**[generative design]** creates new objects or visuals where there were not any before (as if you are growing something) 
//*definitions from week 1 seminar module*

I wasn't that sure about the terms and I thought it would be better to understand it as much as I can.
The Wikipedia says :
Generative design is an iterative design process that involves a program that will generate a certain number of outputs that meet certain constraints, and a designer that will fine tune the feasible region *(=the area that possible to do sth easily?)* by changing minimal and maximal values of an interval in which a variable *(=변수?)* of the program meets the set of constraints, in order to reduce or augment the number of outputs to choose from.
