# Week 01 [24.07.20] 
## Introduction 
So today we started to look at the terms what Parametric & Generative design is first.

**Parametric Design** is dependent on variables that change the geometry or other factors (like a template)
**Generative Design** creates new objects or visuals where there were not any before (as if you are growing something)

###### I wasn't that sure about the terms and I thought it would be better to understand it as much as I can.<br/>
The Wikipedia says :
Generative design is an iterative design process that involves a program that will generate a certain number of outputs that meet certain constraints, and a designer that will fine tune the feasible region *(=the area that possible to do sth easily? 실행가능한 영역)* by changing minimal and maximal values(값) of an interval in which a variable *(=변수?)* of the program meets the set of constraints, in order to reduce or increase the number of outputs to choose from. <br/>
