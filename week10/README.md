## Interesting Findings 01 - Birthday Pseudocode
So on the 4th(Sun), it was my birthday and I got a message from CommonWealth Bank. <br/>
At the moment, I only got one birthday message from one of my friends and that Bank message was the second one that I got.<br/>
I suddenly felt so strange and was seized by a weird feeling of having my birthday celebrated by a robot that was staying within the confines of the rules set for it.<br/>
And also because there are only two options that I can click - 'Thanks' & 'Dismiss', this non-genuine feeling message made me think about the meaning of the birthday. <br/>
They were providing a small service to their customers which I fully understand, but I just felt weird that I get two different paths(buttons) and I knew that both of them will lead me to the same path(outcome=previous page) anyway. It almost feels like I have choices but no choices that I could make. <br/>

So I posted it on my Instagram story saying, 'Slave to the algorithm, IF = bday, send a bday msg', and one of my friends replied back to me like this(the right picture).<br/>
It was funny in a way that we were making a small related pseudocode to communicate and that changed the weird feeling I had into more 'human' feeling.<br/>

## Interesting Findings 02 - Worm's Algorithmic movements
While working on my stuff, I found a tiny movement in the middle of my 23.8 inch monitor. <br/>
So I looked it carefully and it was a tiny worm that tries to find its way!<br/>
I have no idea why it decided to across this wide screen and I was so fascinated by its small decisions.<br/>
I decided to film it with my micro lens(Sorry for the dirts on my screen, but you can't really see the dirts with your eyes as they are tiny).<br/>

And then I tried to visualise its 'Algorithminc instinct movement'. Blue stroke is its path and red dots are its decision making spots. <br/>

I was just surprised that I found it on my screen and that it was similar to what I am currently working on for my project. <br/>
