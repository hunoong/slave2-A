# Week 11 [09.10.20] 
## Current Stage - during the week experiment
During the week, I wanted to test out some birds feeding experiments. <br/>
<br/>
When I was struggling to improve the quality of detection camera the other day as the detector couldn't track the birds well in a far distance, a dove came to my balcony and I saw it resting on the fence.

And I thought it would be nice if I can watch some birds coming right in front of my desk, so that I could test out the 'ML5 Detector' whether it can detect them well or not.<br/>
I knew that it takes time to get their attentions, so once you put some seeds, you need to wait for them to find these treats. <br/>

And because they are super sensitive, I had to be careful not to surprise them.<br/>
After few days, sparrows are the first ones found the seeds on my balcony table. <br/>
I made them frightened several times before, so I don't think I can track them any time soon, now I just need them to be feel safe so that I can track them later. <br/>
