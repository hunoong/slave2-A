# Week 12 [16.10.20] 

## During the week...
Last week, I got some feedback to use 'Classes' for my sketch as I was having some issue in identifying multiple objects at the same time. So I've been working on how to use it and how to apply it into my sketch. I was trying to figure out how to draw brush classes over the capture and there were some parts that I did not understand. I didn't get how to connect 'detection.x(&y)' value to the class value as they couldn't recognise 'x'(from what developer tool says). <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Michael, I was able to show some ellipese on the screen.<br/>

<br/>
If I can make dots appear on the screen, that menas I can be able to connect detection(=brush) with dots(=classes) together. But I just don't know the right path way to attach them together. <br/>

<br/>
So I decided to start the sketch from the scratch with using Classes.<br/>

<br/>
After spending lots of time to sort it out, I was able to make it appeared while being detected.(It shows the movement as the 'random move' was on)<br/>
However, with the limited time I got, I couldn't make it on time because I also needed to refine my sketch as well. At this point, I set the time up till Wednesday(14th). If I couldn't make it by Wednesday, I decided to go with my back up plan and I did.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Back up plan
I had to go with my back up plans.<br/>
> - Using recorded video of birds that I filmed. Not live capturing.
> - Using just **'one brush'** for **'each label'** rather than making **'multiple brushes'** for **'each detection'**. 

So my original plan which was using different brushes for each birds to make different path ways ***(Inspired by a work by Dora Lazeravic)***, was dumped.<br/>

<br/>
But I used 'One main brush' that has some random values in for 'Birds' instead. I put some random values for rectangles and ellipses by using [Air Brush
by aferriss](https://editor.p5js.org/aferriss/sketches/Bk-TfPNlQ). Also, I added my custom brushes so that it can be shown randomly every time I launch the program. <br/>

<br/>
For bird video back up, I tested it first with Youtube videos whether the program could track birds if I show it by using iPad. I turned on the video and made my iPad and Mac face each other and started the program.<br/>

And yes it did its job. Next step was filming birds on my balcony. <br/>

And it worked.<br/>
