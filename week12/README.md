# Week 12 [16.10.20] 

## During the week...
Last week, I got some feedback to use 'Classes' for my sketch as I was having some issue in identifying multiple objects at the same time. So I've been working on how to use it and how to apply it into my sketch. I was trying to figure out how to draw brush classes over the capture and there were some parts that I did not understand. I didn't get how to connect 'detection.x(&y)' value to the class value as they couldn't recognise 'x'(from what developer tool says). <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Michael, I was able to show some ellipese on the screen.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If I can make dots appear on the screen, that menas I can be able to connect detection(=brush) with dots(=classes) together. But I just don't know the right path way to attach them together. <br/>

<br/>
So I decided to start the sketch from the scratch with using Classes.<br/>

<br/>
After spending lots of time to sort it out, I was able to make it appeared while being detected.(It shows the movement as the 'random move' was on)<br/>
However, with the limited time I got, I couldn't make it on time because I also needed to refine my sketch as well. At this point, I set the time up till Wednesday(14th). If I couldn't make it by Wednesday, I decided to go with my back up plan and I did.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

## Back up plan
I had to go with my back up plans.<br/>
> - Using recorded video of birds that I filmed. Not live capturing.
> - Using just **'one brush'** for **'each label'** rather than making **'multiple brushes'** for **'each detection'**. 

So my original plan which was using different brushes for each birds to make different path ways ***(Inspired by a work by Dora Lazeravic)***, was dumped.<br/>

<br/>
But I used 'One main brush' that has some random values in for 'Birds' instead. I put some random values for rectangles and ellipses by using [Air Brush
by aferriss](https://editor.p5js.org/aferriss/sketches/Bk-TfPNlQ). Also, I added my custom brushes so that it can be shown randomly every time I launch the program. <br/>

<br/>
For bird video back up, I tested it first with Youtube videos whether the program could track birds if I show it by using iPad. I turned on the video and made my iPad and Mac face each other and started the program. And yes it did its job.<br/>

<br/>
Next step was filming birds on my balcony. And it worked. <br/>

## Issue
After solving most of problems, there still one issue left which was the program sometimes wasn't working(the camera wasn't showing up) and was very slow.<br/>
Maybe it was due to the library that I imported and it may have needed some time to warm up. Or there was some crash on codes. I don't know why but after spending some time to figure this out, I somehow got a temporary but effective solution for this, **"Opening a new tab"**. <br/>
(Also I solved some slowy and laggy issue by limiting frame rates!)<br/>
Weirdly, the problem got solved by leaving the tab open and opening the new tab.. maybe it wasn't the answer to solve this crash but it worked, and it was very easy but effective. After the camera shows up and it's working, all you need to do is just close of the tabs. Easy Peasy. <br/>
So I made a small error text for users who may get frustrated.<br/>

## Reflection
Lastly, I don't think this project is incredibly refined, but it's still a very proud project for me. I am happy that I have learned a series of problem-solving processes and made results. There are so many things I have learned through this.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, there were quite a bit of difficulties in between and I was embarrassed because I didn't know how to solve them. And I didn't know how to question, and who to ask for help. But I could solve many things with the help of my friends and teachers. When I couldn't figure out how to do it, I remembered what my teacher said when I was in year one. I rested often whenever I stuck. So many ideas and backup plans popped up before go to bed, while taking a shower and even while washing dishes. I could see from a different perspective through relaxtion. And I trusted myself a little more. I decided to believe in myself rather than being harsh to myself. Sometimes if I ended up entering a dead end, I chose to go back. And I think we sometimes need detouring and sometimes you face a happy accident while detouring. <br>
<br/>
At first I doubted(not in a negative way) what this studio had to do with me and what I could learn and get from it. Doubt is something I think is important in the learning process, so I wouldn't blame myself. However, contrary to my doubts, many parts were connected to my previous practices especially to the fine art electives that I took earlier. Unlike I thought I just like to draw, I really enjoyed this course and I was so proud that I was able to program and create a 'work' that reflects my thoughts while working on solving problems. I would like to give a compliment to myself in the past when I chose this studio for my first preference and thank the teachers who provided this studio. I also appreciate my friends who supported me.<br>
