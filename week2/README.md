# Week 02 [31.07.20] 

## 12hrs Challenge


## Summary of week 2
Today we went trough a bunch of artists from 백남준 *(Nam June Paik/ we talked about him at the start of the class for a bit)* to Raven Kwok.<br/>
*(+ Yoko Ono, Sol Lewitt, Manfred Mohr, Roman Verasko, Harold Cohen, Samuel Monnior, Jean Pierre Hebert and Angelo Plessas)*

When Karen mentioned about 'Sublime' as an aesthetic force while speaking of *Sol Lewitt*, I actually quite didn't get it, but vaguely understood.<br/>
So I looked it up a bit more.Mbr/>
This is what WIki said :<br/>
In aesthetics, the sublime(숭고함? 절정?) is the quality of greatness, whether physical, moral, intellectual, metaphysical, aesthetic, spiritual, or artistic. The term especially refers to a greatness beyond all possibility of calculation, measurement, or imitation.<br/>

Among them, for me ***Manfred Mohr*** was quite impressive as he was a painter, but he tried to collaborate with a machine. He set basic parameters and created his parametic designs based one that(He wanted the machine to take decisions that he would not have).<br/>
And this reminded me of ***[James Nolan Gandy](https://instagram.com/gandyworks?igshid=1aunivtu21u7l)***, a drawing machinist. In terms of 'Human-machine collaboration', I think they are similar to some extend, as James also seems like taking machines' decisions as well. I mean, everything's probably based on the artist's thought and decisions(like, specific machine set ups on purpose?), but still seem like they are "collaborating".
